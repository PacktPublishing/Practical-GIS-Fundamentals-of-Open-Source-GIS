# Practical GIS - Fundamentals of Open Source GIS [Video]
This is the code repository for [Practical GIS - Fundamentals of Open Source GIS [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/practical-gis-fundamentals-open-source-gis-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788621397), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The most commonly used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools automate tasks that were historically done manually—compiling new maps by overlaying one on top of the other or physically cutting maps into pieces representing specific study areas, changing their projection, and getting meaningful results from the various layers by applying mathematical functions and operations. This course is an easy-to-follow guide to use the most mature open source GIS tools for these tasks.
You’ll start by setting up the environment for the tools we’ll use in the course. Then you’ll learn how to work with QGIS in order to generate useful spatial data. After that, you’ll get to know the basics of queries, data management, and geoprocessing.
By the end of this course, you’ll have an understanding of the aspects of building a GIS system and will be able to take that knowledge with you to whatever project calls for it.
